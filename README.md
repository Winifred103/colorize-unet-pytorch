## 🎯 Abstract

Automatic colorization of grayscale images is an ill-posed, one-to-many problem that has seen significant progress with deep learning. However, existing methods, particularly standard convolutional en[...]

This project implements a **U-Net architecture from scratch** for automatic image colorization. The model converts grayscale (L*) images to color by predicting the color channels (a*, b*) in the LAB c[...]

## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

The central challenge in automatic image colorization is not just predicting *a* color for each pixel, but predicting **plausible and globally consistent** colors that make sense for the entire scene.

### Common Failure Modes:
1. **Color Drabness:** Models predict "safe," desaturated colors because they represent statistical averages and minimize pixel-wise error.
2. **Color Inconsistency:** Large uniform regions (sky, lake) may be colored with different shades because decisions are made locally without global context.

### Our Approach:
- **Input:** Grayscale image (L* channel from LAB color space)
- **Output:** Two color channels (a*, b*) to reconstruct full-color image
- **Architecture:** U-Net with encoder-decoder structure and skip connections
- **Loss Function:** L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error)
- **Color Space:** LAB (more perceptually uniform than RGB)

## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### U-Net Model Structure

```
Input: 1 channel (L - Grayscale) → Output: 2 channels (ab - Color)
```

**Encoder (Downsampling):**
- 6 convolutional blocks with BatchNorm and ReLU
- Progressive feature extraction: 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 → 512 → 512
- Kernel size: 4×4, Stride: 2, Padding: 1

**Bottleneck:**
- Final compression layer (512 channels)
- Captures highest-level abstract features

**Decoder (Upsampling):**
- 6 transposed convolutional blocks
- Skip connections from encoder for detail preservation
- Dropout (p=0.5) on first 3 decoder layers for regularization
- Progressive upsampling: 512 → 512 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 64

**Output Layer:**
- Final transposed convolution to 2 channels (a, b)
- Tanh activation to bound output to [-1, 1]

### Key Implementation Details

```python
class UNet(nn.Module):
    - Encoder: 6 downsampling blocks
    - Bottleneck: 512 channels at 4×4 resolution (for 256×256 input)
    - Decoder: 6 upsampling blocks with skip connections
    - Skip connections: Concatenation (not addition)
    - Dropout: Applied to first 3 decoder layers
    - Activation: ReLU (encoder/decoder), Tanh (output)
```

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate our model using **Objective Fidelity Criteria** as required:

### 1. PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
$$\text{PSNR} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{MAX}^2}{\text{MSE}}\right)$$

- **Range:** Typically 20-50 dB for images
- **Interpretation:**
  - > 40 dB: Excellent quality
  - 30-40 dB: Good quality
  - 20-30 dB: Acceptable quality
  - < 20 dB: Poor quality

### 2. SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
- **Range:** [-1, 1], where 1 = identical images
- **Interpretation:**
  - > 0.9: Excellent similarity
  - 0.7-0.9: Good similarity
  - 0.5-0.7: Moderate similarity
  - < 0.5: Poor similarity

### 3. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
$$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2}$$

- **Range:** [0, ∞]
- **Interpretation:** Lower is better (0 = perfect match)

### 4. SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
$$\text{SNR} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{Signal Power}}{\text{Noise Power}}\right)$$

- **Range:** Typically -10 to 50 dB
- **Interpretation:** Higher is better (> 20 dB is good)

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pillow scikit-image matplotlib gradio tqdm
```

### Training the Model

```bash
python train.py
```

**Note:** Training has already been completed. The model is saved as `final_colorization_model.pth`.

### Evaluating the Model

Run objective fidelity metrics on test images:

```bash
python evaluation.py
```

This will:
- Evaluate 100 samples from the dataset
- Calculate PSNR, SSIM, RMSE, and SNR for each image
- Save comparison images showing: grayscale input, ground truth, and prediction
- Generate distribution plots for all metrics
- Save summary statistics to `evaluation_results/metrics_summary.txt`

### Running the Demo App

Launch the Gradio web interface locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

Or try the hosted demo on Hugging Face Spaces:

- https://huggingface.co/spaces/AmmarAhm3d/colorize-unet-pytorch

The app will:
- Start a web server with a user-friendly interface
- Allow you to upload grayscale images
- Display colorized results in real-time
- Provide a shareable link for demonstration

## 🎨 How It Works

### Color Space: LAB

We use **LAB color space** instead of RGB because:
- **L (Lightness):** 0-100, represents grayscale information
- **a (Green-Red):** -128 to 127, color opponent dimension
- **b (Blue-Yellow):** -128 to 127, color opponent dimension
- **Perceptually uniform:** Equal changes in LAB values correspond to equal perceptual differences
- **Separates luminance from color:** Perfect for colorization task

### Inference Pipeline

1. **Input:** Grayscale image (can be RGB converted to grayscale)
2. **Convert to LAB:** Extract L channel
3. **Normalize:** L channel to [-1, 1]
4. **Predict:** Model outputs ab channels [-1, 1]
5. **Denormalize:** Convert back to LAB range
6. **Reconstruct:** Combine L (original) + ab (predicted)
7. **Convert to RGB:** Final colorized image

### Future Enhancements (Discussed but Not Implemented)

The **Learnable Color Palette** concept for globally-aware colorization:
- Attention mechanism at bottleneck to select scene-appropriate color palettes
- Global context injection into decoder
- Would address color drabness and inconsistency issues
- Lightweight alternative to GANs for vibrant colorization
